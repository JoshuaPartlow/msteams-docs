# Prepare accounts to build Teams apps

To create a Teams app and upload, you need to prepare the following accounts:

* [Microsoft 365 account with valid subscription.](accounts.md#microsoft-365-account)
* [Azure account to host the backend resources on Azure](accounts.md#azure-account-to-host-backend-resources).

## Microsoft 365 account

To create a Microsoft 365 account, sign up for a Microsoft 365 developer program subscription. The subscription is free for 90 days and continues to renew as long as you're using it for development activity.

If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 [developer subscription](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits). It's active as long as your Visual Studio subscription is active. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).

### Microsoft 365 developer program

To get a free Teams developer account, join the Microsoft 365 developer program and perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
2. Select **Join Now**.
3. Select **Set up E5 subscription**.
4. Set up your administrator account.

   The following image is shown after you complete the subscription:

### Microsoft 365 developer account types

You can sign up for the developer program by using one of the following account types:

- **Microsoft account for personal use**

    The Microsoft account provides you access to Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook, Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Microsoft 365. You can sign up for an Outlook.com mailbox to create a Microsoft account, which can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

- **Microsoft work account for business**

     This account provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to represent your organization.

- **Visual Studio user id**

    The user ID created to use Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscription can be used to join the developer program within the Visual Studio Gallery to avail full benefits as a Visual Studio subscriber.

## Azure account to host backend resources

Azure account is optional if your existing application is hosted on other cloud provider and you want to integrate the existing application on Teams platform.

**Visual Studio ID**

If you want to host your application related resources or access resources within Azure, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin. Alternatively you can select to host your backend resources using another cloud provider, or on your own servers if they're available from the public domain.

## Teams custom app upload or sideload permission

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as **sideloading**.

   You can verify if the sideloading permission is enabled using either Visual Studio Code or Teams client.

* **Verify sideloading permission using Visual Studio Code**

    1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
    1. Select **Teams Toolkit** from the left panel. If you're unable to see the option ensure that you have installed Teams Toolkit extension.
    1. Select **Accounts** and log in to your Microsoft 365 account.
    1. Check whether you can view the option **Sideloading enabled** as shown in the following image:

       :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/sideloading.png" alt-text="Enable sideloading" border="true":::

* **Verify sideloading permission using Teams client**

    1. Open **Microsoft Teams**.
    2. Select **Apps** in left panel.
    3. Select **Publish an app**.

       :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/publish.png" alt-text="Publish an app" border="true":::

    4. Check whether you can see the option **Upload a custom app** as shown in the following image:

       :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/upload.png" alt-text="Upload a custom app" border="true":::

        If you are unable to view the option Upload a custom app,** then, it indicates that you don't have the required permission for sideloading.
        * For a tenant admin, enable the sideloading setting for your tenant or organization in the Teams admin center.
        * If you aren't a tenant admin, you'll need to contact your tenant admin to enable sideloading.

### Upload your custom app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To turn on custom app uploading or sideloading for your developer tenant, you must be the admin for your tenant.

**To upload the custom app**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/homepage#/) with your admin credentials.

2. Select **Show All** > **Teams**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/5.png" alt-text="show all" border="true":::

   > [!Note]
   > It can take **up to 24 hours** for the **Teams** option to appear. You can [upload your custom app to a Teams environment](/microsoftteams/upload-custom-apps) for testing and validation.

3. Navigate to **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.

5. Select **Save**.

   > [!Note]
   > It can take up to 24 hours for sideloading to become active. In the meantime, you can use **upload for your tenant** to test your app. To upload the .zip package file of the app, see [Upload custom apps](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

For more information, see [Manage custom app policies and settings in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings) and [Manage app setup policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).
