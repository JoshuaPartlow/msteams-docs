# Deploy to the cloud

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload the frontend and backend code in your application to your provisioned cloud resources in Azure.

* The tab, such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage and configured for static web hosting or a sharepoint site.
* The backend APIs are deployed to Azure functions.
* The bot or message extension is deployed to Azure app service.

## Prerequisite

* [Install Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Ensure you have Teams app project opened in VS code.
> * Before you deploy project code to cloud, [provision the cloud resources](provision.md).
