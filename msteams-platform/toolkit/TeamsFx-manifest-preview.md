# Preview app manifest in Toolkit

The manifest template file `manifest.template.json` is available under `templates/appPackage` folder after scaffolding. The Template file with placeholders, and the actual values is resolved by Teams Toolkit from files under `.fx/configs` and `.fx/states` for different environments.

## Prerequisite

* Install the [latest version of Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you have Teams app project opened in Visual Studio code.

## Preview manifest

To preview manifest with real content, Teams Toolkit generates preview manifest files under `build/appPackage` folder:

```text
└───build
    └───appPackage
        ├───appPackage.{env}.zip - Zipped app package of remote teams app
        ├───appPackage.local.zip - Zipped app package of local team app
        ├───manifest.{env}.json  - Previewed manifest of remote teams app
        └───manifest.local.json  - Previewed manifest of local teams app
```
