# Manage your apps with the Developer Portal for Microsoft Teams

The <a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal for Teams</a> is the primary tool for configuring, distributing, and managing your Microsoft Teams apps. With the Developer Portal, you can collaborate with colleagues on your app, set up runtime environments, and much more.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Currently, Developer Portal is not available for Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC-High, or Department of Defense (DOD) tenants.
> * However, you can use a regular tenant to build an app in the Developer Portal, download the app, and upload the app using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) to a national cloud. For more information, see [National cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

## Register an app

The Developer Portal provides a couple ways to register a Teams app:

* Register a brand new app
* Import an existing app package

> [!NOTE]
> If you create an app using the [Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension), you can manage that app in the Developer Portal.

## Set up an environment

You can configure environments and global variables to help transition your app from your local runtime to production. Global variables are used across all environments.

To set up an environment:

1. In the Developer Portal, select the app you're working on.
2. Go to the **Environments** page and select **+ Add an environment**.
3. Select **+ Add a variable** to create configuration variables for your environment.

To use variables:

Use the variable names instead of hard-coded values to set your app configurations.

1. Enter `{{` in any field in the Developer Portal. A dropdown with all the variables you've created for the chosen environment along with the global variables appears.  
1. Before downloading your app package (for example, when getting ready to publish to the Teams store), select the environment you want to use. Your app configurations update automatically based on the environment.

## Identify app owners

Each app includes an **Owners** page, where you can share your app registration with colleagues in your org. The **Contributor** role has the same permissions as the **Owner** role except the ability to delete an app.

## Configure your app's capabilities and other important metadata

A Teams app is a web app. Like all web apps, its source code is typically developed in an IDE or code editor and hosted somewhere in the cloud (like Azure).

To install and render your app in Teams, you must include a set of configurations that Teams recognizes. This has traditionally been done by crafting an app manifest, a JSON file that contains all the metadata Teams needs to display your app content. The Developer Portal abstracts this process and includes new features and tooling to help you be more successful.

## Test your app directly in Teams

The Developer Portal provides options for testing and debugging your app:

* On the **Overview** page, you can see a snapshot of whether your app's configurations validate against Teams store test cases.
* The **Preview in Teams** button lets you launch your app quickly in the Teams client for debugging.

## Distribute your app

From the Developer Portal, use the **Distribute** button to download an app package, publish to your org, or publish to the Teams store.

For more information, see [distribute your Teams app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md).

## Use tools to create app features

The Developer Portal also includes tools to help you build some key features of Teams apps. Some of these tools include:

* **Scene studio**: Design [custom Together Mode scenes](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/teams-together-mode.md) for Teams meetings.
* **Adaptive Cards editor**: Create and preview Adaptive Cards to include with your apps.
* **Microsoft identity platform management**: Register your apps with Azure Active Directory to help users sign in and provide access to APIs.
