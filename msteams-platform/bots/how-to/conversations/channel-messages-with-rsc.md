# Receive all channel messages with RSC

The resource-specific consent (RSC) permissions model, originally developed for Teams Graph APIs, is extended to bot scenarios.

Using RSC, you can now request team owners to consent for a bot to receive user messages across standard channels in a team without being @mentioned. This capability is enabled by specifying the `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` permission in the manifest of an RSC enabled Teams app. After configuration, team owners can grant consent during the app installation process.

For more information about enabling RSC for your app, see [resource-specific consent in Teams](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent#update-your-teams-app-manifest).

## Enable bots to receive all channel messages

The `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` RSC permission is extended to bots. With user consent, this permission allows graph applications to get all messages in a conversation and bots to receive all channel messages without being @mentioned.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Services that need access to all Teams message data must use the Graph APIs that also provide access to archived data in channels and chats.
> * Bots must use the `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` RSC permission appropriately to build and enhance engaging experience for users in the team or they will not pass the store approval. The app description must include how the bot uses the data it reads.
> * The `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` RSC permission may not be used by bots as a way to extract large amounts of customer data.

## Update app manifest

For your bot to receive all channel messages, RSC must be configured in the Teams app manifest with the `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` permission specified in the `webApplicationInfo` property.

![Update app manifest](~/bots/how-to/conversations/Media/appmanifest.png)


The following is an example of the `webApplicationInfo` object:

* **id**: Your Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app ID. This can be the same as your bot ID.
* **resource**: Any string. This field has no operation in RSC, but must be added and have a value to avoid error response.
* **applicationPermissions**: RSC permissions for your app with `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` must be specified. For more information, see [resource-specific permissions](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent#resource-specific-permissions).

The following code provides an example of the app manifest:

```json
"webApplicationInfo": {
"id": "XXxxXXXXX-XxXX-xXXX-XXxx-XXXXXXXxxxXX",
"resource": "https://AnyString",
"applicationPermissions": [
"ChannelMessage.Read.Group"
    ]
  }
```

## Sideload in a team

To sideload in a team to test, whether all channel messages in a team with RSC are received without being @mentioned:

1. Select or create a team.
1. Select the ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; from the left pane. The drop-down menu appears.
1. Select **Manage team** from the drop-down menu. The details appear.

      :::image type="content" source="Media/managingteam.png" alt-text="managing team"border="true":::

1. Select **Apps**. Multiple apps appear.
1. Select **Upload a custom app** from the lower right corner.

      :::image type="content" source="Media/uploadingcustomapp.png" alt-text="uploading custom app":::
  
1. Select the app package from the **Open** dialog box.
1. Select **Open**.

1. Select **Add** from the app details pop-up, to add the bot to your selected team.

1. Select a channel and enter a message in the channel for your bot.

    The bot receives the message without being @mentioned.

## Code snippets

The following code provides an example of RSC permissions:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp

// Handle when a message is addressed to the bot. 
// When rsc is enabled the method will be called even when bot is addressed without being @mentioned
protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
  await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text("Using RSC the bot can recieve messages across channels in team without being @mentioned."));
}
```

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

```javascript

// Handle when a message is addressed to the bot. 
// When rsc is enabled the method will be called even when bot is addressed without being @mentioned
this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
   await context.sendActivity(MessageFactory.text("Using RSC the bot can recieve messages across channles in team without being @mentioned."))
   await next();
});
```
