# Bot command menus

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

To define a set of core commands that your bot can respond to, you can add a command menu with a drop-down list of commands for your bot. The list of commands is presented to the users in the compose message area when they are in conversation with your bot. Select a command from the list to insert the command string into the compose message box and select **Send**.

## Create a command menu for your bot

Command menus are defined in your app manifest. You can either use **App Studio** to create them or add them manually in the app manifest.

### Create a command menu for your bot using App Studio

A prerequisite to create a command menu for your bot is that you must edit an existing app manifest. The steps to add a command menu are the same, whether you create a new manifest or edit an existing one.

**To create a command menu for your bot using App Studio**

1. Open Teams and select **Apps** from the left pane. In the **Apps** page, search for **App Studio**, and select **Open**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't have **App Studio**, you can download it. For more information, see [installing App Studio](~/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview.md#installing-app-studio).

  > If you have been using App Studio, we recommend that you'd try the Developer Portal to configure, distribute, and manage your Teams apps. App Studio will be deprecated by June 30, 2022

2. In **App Studio**, select the **Manifest editor** tab. If you do not have an existing app package, you can create or import an existing app. For more information, see [update an app package](~/get-started/deploy-csharp-app-studio.md).

3. In the left pane of the **Manifest editor** and in the **Capabilities** section, select **Bots**.

4. In the right pane of the **Manifest editor** and in the **Commands** section, select **Add**. The **New Command** screen appears.

    :::image type="content" source="/media/AppStudio-CommandMenu-Add.png" alt-text="Select the app package"lightbox="/media/AppStudio-CommandMenu-Add.png"border="true":::

5. Enter the **Command text** that must appear as the command menu for your bot.

6. Enter the **Help text** that must appear under the command text in the menu. **Help text** must be a brief explanation of the purpose of the command.

7. Select the **Scope** check boxes to select where this command menu must appear, and select **Save**.

### Create a command menu for your bot by editing Manifest.json

Another way to create a command menu is to create it directly in the manifest file while developing your bot source code. To use this method, follow these points:

* Each menu supports up to ten commands.
* Create a single command menu that works in all scopes.
* Create a different command menu for each scope.

#### Manifest example for single menu for both scopes

The manifest example code for single menu for both scopes is as follows:

```json
{
  â‹®
  "bots":[
    {
      "botId":"[Microsoft App ID for your bot]",
      "scopes": [
        "personal",
        "team"
      ],
      "commandLists":[
        {
          "scopes":[
            "team",
            "personal"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
              "title":"Help",
              "description":"Displays this help message"
            },
            {
              "title":"Search Flights",
              "description":"Search flights from Seattle to Phoenix May 2-5 departing after 3pm"
            },
            {
              "title":"Search Hotels",
              "description":"Search hotels in Portland tonight"
            },
            {
              "title":"Best Time to Fly",
              "description":"Best time to fly to London for a 5 day trip this summer"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

#### Manifest example for the menu for each scope

The manifest example code for the menu for each scope is as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "bots":[
    {
      "botId":"<Microsoft app ID for your bot>",
      "scopes": [
        "groupChat",
        "team"
      ],
      "commandLists":[
        {
          "scopes":[
            "team"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
            "title":"help",
            "description":"Displays this help message for channels"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "scopes":[
            "groupChat"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
            "title":"help",
            "description":"Displays this help message for group chat"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

You must handle menu commands in your bot code as you handle any message from users. You can handle menu commands in your bot code by parsing out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text.

## Handle menu commands in your bot code

Bots in a group or channel respond only when they are mentioned `@botname` in a message. Every message received by a bot when in a group or channel scope contains its name in the message text. Before handling the command being returned, your message parsing must handle the message received by a bot with its name.

> [!NOTE]
> To handle the commands in code, they are sent to your bot as a regular message. You must handle them as you would handle any other message from your users. The commands in code insert pre-configured text into the text box. The user must then send that text as they do for any other message.

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

You can parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Microsoft Bot Framework. It is a method of the `Activity` class named `RemoveRecipientMention`.

The C# code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```csharp
var modifiedText = turnContext.Activity.RemoveRecipientMention();
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

You can parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Bot Framework. It is a method of the `TurnContext` class named `removeMentionText`.

The JavaScript code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```javascript
const modifiedText = TurnContext.removeMentionText(turnContext.activity, turnContext.activity.recipient.id);
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

You can parse out the **@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Bot Framework. It is a method of the `TurnContext` class named `remove_recipient_mention`.

The Python code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```python
modified_text = TurnContext.remove_recipient_mention(turn_context.activity)
```

To enable smooth functioning of your bot code, there are few best practices that you must follow.

## Command menu best practices

Following are the command menu best practices:

* Keep it simple: The bot menu is meant to present the key capabilities of your bot.
* Keep it short: Menu options must not be long and must not be complex natural language statements. They must be simple commands.
* Keep it invokable: Bot menu actions or commands must always be available, regardless of the state of the conversation or the dialog the bot is in.

> [!NOTE]
> If you remove any commands from your manifest, you must redeploy your app to implement the changes. In general, any changes to the manifest require you to redeploy your app.
