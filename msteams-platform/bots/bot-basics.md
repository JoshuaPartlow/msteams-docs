# Bot activity handlers

This document builds on the article on [how bots work](https://aka.ms/how-bots-work) in the core [Bot Framework documentation](https://aka.ms/azure-bot-service-docs). The primary difference between bots developed for Microsoft Teams and the core Bot Framework is in the features provided in Teams.

To organize the conversational logic for your bot, an activity handler is used. Activities are handled in two ways using Teams activity handlers and bot logic. The Teams activity handler adds support for Microsoft Teams-specific events and interactions. The bot object contains the conversational reasoning or logic for a turn and exposes a turn handler, which is the method that can accept incoming activities from the bot adapter.

## Teams activity handlers

Teams activity handler is derived from Microsoft Bot Framework's activity handler. It routes all Teams activities before allowing any non-Teams specific activities to be handled.

When a bot for Teams receives an activity, it is routed to the activity handlers. All activities are routed through one base handler called the turn handler. The turn handler calls the required activity handler to manage any activity received. The Teams bot is derived from `TeamsActivityHandler` class, which is derived from the Bot Framework's `ActivityHandler` class.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

Bots are created using the Bot Framework. If the bots receive a message activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity. The turn handler then sends the incoming activity to the `OnMessageActivityAsync` activity handler. In Teams, this functionality remains the same. If the bot receives a conversation update activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity and sends the incoming activity to `OnConversationUpdateActivityAsync`. The Teams activity handler first checks for any Teams specific events. If no events are found, it then passes them along to the Bot Framework's activity handler.

In the Teams activity handler class, there are two primary Teams activity handlers, `OnConversationUpdateActivityAsync` and `OnInvokeActivityAsync`. `OnConversationUpdateActivityAsync` routes all conversation update activities and `OnInvokeActivityAsync` routes all Teams invoke activities.

To implement your logic for Teams specific activity handlers, you must override the methods in your bot as shown in the [bot logic](#bot-logic) section. There is no base implementation for these handlers, therefore, you must add the logic that you want in your override.

The code snippets for Teams activity handlers:

`OnTeamsChannelCreatedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsChannelCreatedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // Code logic here
        }
```

`OnTeamsChannelDeletedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsChannelDeletedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // Code logic here
        }
```

`OnTeamsChannelRenamedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsChannelRenamedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
   // Code logic here
  }
```

`OnTeamsTeamRenamedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsTeamRenamedAsync(TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
   // Code logic here
  }
```

`OnTeamsMembersAddedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsMembersAddedAsync(IList<TeamsChannelAccount> teamsMembersAdded, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
   // Code logic here
  }
```

`OnTeamsMembersRemovedAsync`

```csharp

protected override Task OnTeamsMembersRemovedAsync(IList<TeamsChannelAccount> teamsMembersRemoved, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
  {
   // Code logic here
  }
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

Bots are created using the Bot Framework. If the bots receive a message activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity. The turn handler then sends the incoming activity to the `onMessage` activity handler. In Teams, this functionality remains the same. If the bot receives a conversation update activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity and sends the incoming activity to `dispatchConversationUpdateActivity`. The Teams activity handler first checks for any Teams specific events. If no events are found, it then passes them along to the Bot Framework's activity handler.

In the Teams activity handler class, there are two primary Teams activity handlers, `dispatchConversationUpdateActivity` and `onInvokeActivity`. `dispatchConversationUpdateActivity` routes all conversation update activities and `onInvokeActivity` routes all Teams invoke activities.

To implement your logic for Teams specific activity handlers, you must override the methods in your bot as shown in the [bot logic](#bot-logic) section. Define your bot logic for these handlers, then be sure to call `next()` at the end. By calling `next()` you ensure that the next handler runs.

The code snippets for Teams activity handlers:

`OnTeamsChannelCreatedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsChannelCreated(async (channelInfo, teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
        await next()
    });
```

`OnTeamsChannelDeletedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsChannelDeleted(async (channelInfo, teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
       await next()
    });
```

`OnTeamsChannelRenamedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsChannelRenamed(async (channelInfo, teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
       await next()
    });
```

`OnTeamsTeamRenamedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsTeamRenamedAsync(async (teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
       await next()
    });
```

`OnTeamsMembersAddedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsMembersAdded(async (membersAdded, teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
    await next();
    });
```

`OnTeamsMembersRemovedAsync`

```javascript

onTeamsMembersRemoved(async (membersRemoved, teamInfo, context, next) => {
       // code for handling
    await next();
    });
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

Bots are created using the Bot Framework. If the bots receive a message activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity. The turn handler then sends the incoming activity to the `on_message_activity` activity handler. In Teams, this functionality remains the same. If the bot receives a conversation update activity, then the turn handler receives a notification of that incoming activity and sends the incoming activity to `on_conversation_update_activity`. The Teams activity handler first checks for any Teams specific events. If no events are found, it then passes them along to the Bot Framework's activity handler.

In the Teams activity handler class, there are two primary Teams activity handlers, `on_conversation_update_activity` and `on_invoke_activity`. `on_conversation_update_activity` routes all conversation update activities and `on_invoke_activity` routes all Teams invoke activities.

To implement your logic for Teams specific activity handlers, you must override the methods in your bot as shown in the [bot logic](#bot-logic) section. There is no base implementation for these handlers, therefore, you must add the logic that you want in your override.

## Bot logic

The bot logic processes incoming activities from one or more of your bot channels and in response generates outgoing activities. This is still true of bots derived from the Teams activity handler class, which first checks for Teams activities. After checking for Teams activities, it passes all other activities to the Bot Framework's activity handler.
