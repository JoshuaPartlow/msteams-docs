# App templates for Microsoft Teams

App templates are examples of complete apps for Microsoft Teams that are open-source and available on GitHub. Each app template contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization. It also provides a sample app that you can install and start using immediately. The complete source code is also available, which allows you to explore it in detail or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific requirements.
All app templates are provided under the [MIT License](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-eprescription/blob/master/LICENSE) terms.

> [!NOTE]
> You must license and support apps created from app templates for your users and organizations.

The key benefits of using App templates are:

* **Deploy directly to the cloud:** All app templates include deployment scripts that allows you to host all required services in Microsoft Azure or the Power Platform.
* **Recommended sample code:** The app templates conform to recommended best practices around security and infrastructure. All community submitted changes to the app templates are reviewed to ensure conformance.
* **Customizable and extensible:** While all app templates are deployed with minimal configuration, the entire code base and deployment scripts are provided, so that you can easily customize or extend them to fit your unique needs.
* **Detailed documentation:** All app templates are accompanied by end-to-end documentation on solution architecture, deployment, and configuration steps.

## FAQ Plus

Conversational Q&A bots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. But, most bots fail to engage with users in meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the bot fails. FAQ bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it is contained in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the user to submit a query which then gets posted to a pre-configured team of experts who help to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within the team itself.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest release of **FAQ Plus** supports improved Q&A resolutions by enabling a team of experts to complete the following:
>
> &#x2714; Add new Q&As directly to the knowledge base using message extensions.
>
> &#x2714; Edit and delete Q&A pairs added by a bot.
>
> &#x2714; Track the revision history of Q&As.
>
> &#x2714; Configure an answer with additional details to display as an [Adaptive Card](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#adaptive-card).
