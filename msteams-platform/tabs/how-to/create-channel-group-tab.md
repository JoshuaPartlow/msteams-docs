# Channel or group tab

Channel or group tabs deliver content to channels and group chats, and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](msteams-docs/msteams-platform/includes/sdk-include.md)]

::: zone pivot="node-java-script"

## Create a custom channel or group tab with Node.js

1. At the command prompt, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by entering the following command after installing the **Node.js**:

    ```cmd
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

1. At the command prompt, install Microsoft Teams App generator by entering the following command:

    ```cmd
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

```cmd
gulp manifest
```

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the `./dist` folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```bash
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab" border="true":::

1. To view your tab configuration page, go to `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/config.html`. The following is shown:

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/configurationPage.png" alt-text="Tab configuration page" border="true":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

To establish a secure tunnel to your tab, exit the localhost and enter the following command:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok**, and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends. If you restart your ngrok session, you must update your app with the new URL.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Microsoft Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** and **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the app package zip folder, and choose **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/channeltabadded.png" alt-text="Uploaded channel tab" border="true":::

1. Select **Add** in the dialog. Your tab is uploaded to Teams.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If  **Add** doesn't display in the dialog box then remove the following code from the manifest of the uploaded app package zip folder. Again zip the folder and upload it to Teams.
    >
    >```Json
    >"staticTabs": [],
    >"bots": [],
    >"connectors": [],
    >"composeExtensions": [],
    >```

1. Follow the directions for adding a tab. There is a custom configuration dialog for your channel or group tab.
1. Select **Save** and your tab is added to the channel's tab bar.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/channeltabuploaded.png" alt-text="Channel tab uploaded" border="true":::

    Now you have succesfully created and added your channel or group tab in Teams.

## Create a custom channel or group tab with ASP.NET Core

1. At the command prompt, create a new directory for your tab project.

1. Clone the sample repository into your new directory using the following command or you can download the [source code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples) and extract the files:

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

Following are the steps to create a channel or group tab:

* [Generate your application with a channel or group tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-channel-or-group-tab-1)
* [Establish a secure tunnel to your tab](#establish-a-secure-tunnel-to-your-tab-1)
* [Update your application](#update-your-application)
* [Build and run your application](#build-and-run-your-application-1)
* [Update your app package with Developer Portal](#update-your-app-package-with-developer-portal)
* [Preview your app in Teams](#preview-your-app-in-teams)

### Generate your application with a channel or group tab

1. Open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.

1. Go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** > **samples** > **tab-channel-group** > **razor-csharp** folder and open **channelGroupTab.sln**.

1. In Visual Studio, select **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from your application's **Debug** menu to verify if the application has loaded properly. In a browser, go to the following URLs:

    * https://localhost:3978/
    * https://localhost:3978/privacy
    * https://localhost:3978/tou

<details>
<summary><b>Review the source code</b></summary>

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced * Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template does not enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### Tab.cs

This C# file contains a method that is called from **Tab.cshtml** during configuration.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A **full color icon** measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A **transparent outline icon** measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files need to be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. When a user chooses to add or update your tab, Microsoft Teams loads the `configurationUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an IFrame, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

</details>

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt in the root of your project directory run the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
ngrok http 3978 --host-header=localhost
```

Ensure that you keep the command prompt with ngrok running and make a note of the URL.

### Update your application

1. Open Visual Studio Solution Explorer and go to the **Pages** > **Shared** folder and open **_Layout.cshtml**, and add the following to the <head> tags section:

    ```html
    <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/sdk/v1.6.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>
    ```
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not copy and paste the `<script src="...">` URLs from this page, as they do not represent the latest version. To get the latest version of the SDK, always go to [Microsoft Teams JavaScript API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js).
    
1. Insert a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize();` in the `script` tag.

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer go to the **Pages** folder and open **Tab.cshtml**

    Within **Tab.cshtml** the application presents the user with two option buttons for displaying the tab with either a red or gray icon. Choosing the **Select Gray** or **Select Red** button triggers `saveGray()` or `saveRed()`, respectively, sets `pages.config.setValidityState(true)`, and enables the **Save** button on the configuration page. This code lets Teams know that you have completed the configuration requirements and the installation can proceed. The parameters of `pages.config.setConfig` are set. Finally, `saveEvent.notifySuccess()` is called to indicate that the content URL has been successfully resolved.

1. Update the `websiteUrl` and `contentUrl` values in each function with the HTTPS ngrok URL to your tab.

    Your code should now include the following with **y8rCgT2b** replaced with your ngrok URL:

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

    ```javascript
        
        let saveGray = () => {
            pages.config.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
                pages.config.setConfig({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/gray/`,
                    entityId: "grayIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
            });
        }

        let saveRed = () => {
            pages.config.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
               pages.config.setConfig({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/red/`,
                    entityId: "redIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
        });
        }
    ```

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

    ```javascript
        
        let saveGray = () => {
            microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
                microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/gray/`,
                    entityId: "grayIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
            });
        }

        let saveRed = () => {
            microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
                microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/red/`,
                    entityId: "redIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
        });
        }
    ```

***
1. Save the updated **Tab.cshtml**.

### Build and run your application

1. In Visual Studio, select **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.

1. Verify that **ngrok** is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

    > [!TIP]
    > You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete the steps provided in this article. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it, **keep ngrok running**. It listens and resumes routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you have to restart the ngrok service it returns a new URL and you have to update your application with the new URL.

<!--- TBD: This note seems to be removed from main. Commenting it for now.
> [!NOTE]
> App Studio can be used to edit your `manifest.json` file and upload the completed package to Teams. You can also manually edit the `manifest.json` file. If you do, ensure that you build the solution again to create the `tab.zip` file to upload.

#### Models

**ChannelGroup.cs** presents a Message object and methods that will be called from the controllers during configuration.

#### Views

These are the different views in ASP.NET Core MVC:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** will be displayed as the home page for your application.

* Shared: The partial view markup **_Layout.cshtml** contains the application's overall page structure and shared visual elements. It will also reference the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

The controllers use the `ViewBag` property to transfer values dynamically to the views.

1. Make sure to save the updated **Tab.cshtml**.

### Build and run your application

1. In Visual Studio, select **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.

1. Verify that **ngrok** is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

    > [!TIP]
    > You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete the steps provided in this article. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it, **keep ngrok running**. It listens and resumes routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you have to restart the ngrok service it returns a new URL and you have to update your application with the new URL.

### Update your app package with Developer Portal

1. Go to Microsoft Teams. If you use the [web-based version](https://teams.microsoft.com), you can inspect your front-end code using your browser's [developer tools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).

1. Go to [**Developer portal**](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).

1. Open **Apps** and select **Import app**.

1. The name of your app package is **tab.zip**. It's available in the following path:

    ```bash
    /bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/tab.zip
    ```

1. Select **tab.zip** and open it in the Developer Portal.

1. A default **App ID** is created and populated in **Basic information** section.

1. Add the Short and Long description  for your app in **Descriptions**.

1. In **Developer Information**, add the required details and in **Website (must be a valid HTTPS URL)** give your ngrok HTTPS URL.

1. In **App URLs**, update the Privacy policy to `https://<yourngrokurl>/privacy` and Terms of use to `https://<yourngrokurl>/tou` and save.

1. In **App features**, select Group and channel app. Update the **Configuration URL** with `https://<yourngrokurl>/tab` and select your tab **Scope**.

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the Domains section, domains from your tabs must contain your ngrok URL without the HTTPS prefix `<yourngrokurl>.ngrok.io`.

### Preview your app in Teams

1. Select **Preview in Teams** from the Developer Portal toolbar, Developer Portal informs you that your app is sideloaded successfully. The **Add** page appears for your app in Teams.

1. Select **Add to team** to Set up the tab in a team. Configure your tab and select **Save**. Your tab is now available in Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/channeltabaspnetuploaded.png" alt-text="Channel tab ASPNET MVC uploaded" border="true":::
    
    Now you have succesfully created and added your channel or group tab in Teams.
