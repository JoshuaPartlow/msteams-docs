# Tabs link unfurling and Stage View

Stage View is a new user interface (UI) component, which allows you to render the content that is opened in full screen in Teams and pinned as a tab.

## Stage View

Stage View is a full screen UI component that you can invoke to surface your web content. The existing link unfurling service is updated so that it is used to turn URLs into a tab using an Adaptive Card and Chat Services. When a user sends a URL in a chat or channel, the URL is unfurled to an Adaptive Card. The user can select **View** in the card, and pin the content as a tab directly from Stage View.

## Advantage of Stage View

Stage View helps provide a more seamless experience of viewing content in Teams. Users can open and view the content provided by your app without leaving the context, and they can pin the content to the chat or channel for future quick access leading to a higher user engagement with your app.

## Stage View vs. Task module

|Stage View|Task module|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Stage View is useful when you have rich content to display to the users, such as a page, a dashboard, a file, and so on. It provides rich features that helps to render your content in the full-screen canvas.|[Task module](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-tabs.md) is especially useful to display messages that require user attention, or collect information required to move to the next step.|
  
## Invoke Stage View

You can invoke Stage View in the following  ways:

* [Invoke Stage View from Adaptive Card](#invoke-stage-view-from-adaptive-card)
* [Invoke Stage View through deep link](#invoke-stage-view-through-deep-link)

## Invoke Stage View from Adaptive Card

When the user enters a URL on the Teams desktop client, the bot is invoked and returns an [Adaptive Card](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md) with the option to open the URL in a stage. After a stage is launched and the `tabInfo` is provided, you can add the ability to pin the stage as a tab.  

The following images display a stage opened from an Adaptive Card:

[![Open a stage from Adaptive Card](~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card1.png)](~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card1.png#lightbox)

[![Open a stage](~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card2.png)](~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card2.png#lightbox)

### Example

Following is the code to open a stage from an Adaptive Card:

```json
{
    type: "Action.Submit",
    name: "View",
    data: {
          msteams: {
            type: "invoke",
            value: {
                type: "tab/tabInfoAction",
                tabInfo: {
                    contentUrl: contentUrl,
                    websiteUrl: websiteUrl,
                    name: "Tasks",
                    entityId: "entityId"
                 }
                }
            }
        }
} 
```

The `invoke` request type must be `composeExtension/queryLink`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * `invoke` workflow is similar to the current `appLinking` workflow.
> * To maintain consistency, it is recommended to name `Action.Submit` as `View`.
> * `websiteUrl` is a required property to be passed in the `TabInfo` object.

Following is the process to invoke Stage View:

* When the user selects **View**, the bot receives an `invoke` request. The request type is `composeExtension/queryLink`.
* `invoke` response from bot contains an Adaptive Card with type `tab/tabInfoAction` in it.
* The bot responds with a `200` code.

> [!NOTE]
> On Teams mobile clients, invoking Stage View for apps distributed through the [Teams store](/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md) and not having a moblie-optimized experience opens the default web browser of the device. The browser opens the URL specified in the `websiteUrl` parameter of the `TabInfo` object.

## Invoke Stage View through deep link

To invoke the Stage View through deep link from your tab, you must wrap the deep link URL in the `microsoftTeams.executeDeeplink(url)` API. The deep link can also be passed through an `OpenURL` action in the card.

### Syntax

Following is the deeplink syntax:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{appId}/0?context={"contentUrl":"contentUrl","websiteUrl":"websiteUrl","name":"Contoso"}
 
### Examples

When a user enters a URL, it is unfurled into an Adaptive card.

Following are the deep link examples to invoke Stage View:

**Example 1: URL with threadId**

Unencoded URL:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/be411542-2bd5-46fb-8deb-a3d5f85156f6/0?context={"contentUrl":"https://teams-alb.wakelet.com/teams/collection/e4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191","websiteUrl":"https://teams-alb.wakelet.com/teams/collection/e4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191?standalone=true","title":"Quotes:Miscellaneous","threadId":"19:9UryYW9rjwnq-vwmBcexGjN1zQSNX0Y4oEAgtUC7WI81@thread.tacv2"}

Encoded URL:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/be411542-2bd5-46fb-8deb-a3d5f85156f6/0?context=%7B%22contentUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fteams-alb.wakelet.com%2Fteams%2Fcollection%2Fe4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191%22%2C%22websiteUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fteams-alb.wakelet.com%2Fteams%2Fcollection%2Fe4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191%3Fstandalone%3Dtrue%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Quotes%3A%20Miscellaneous%22%2C%22threadId%22%3A%2219:9UryYW9rjwnq-vwmBcexGjN1zQSNX0Y4oEAgtUC7WI81@thread.tacv2%22%7D

**Example 2: URL with no threadId**

Unencoded URL:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/43f56af0-8615-49e6-9635-7bea3b5802c2/0?context={"contentUrl":"https://teams-alb.wakelet.com/teams/collection/e4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191","websiteUrl":"https://teams-alb.wakelet.com/teams/collection/e4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191?standalone=true","title":"Quotes:Miscellaneous"}

Encoded

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/43f56af0-8615-49e6-9635-7bea3b5802c2/0?context=%7B%22contentUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fteams-alb.wakelet.com%2Fteams%2Fcollection%2Fe4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191%22%2C%22websiteUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fteams-alb.wakelet.com%2Fteams%2Fcollection%2Fe4173826-5dae-4de0-b77d-bfabafd6f191%3Fstandalone%3Dtrue%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Quotes%3A%20Miscellaneous%22%7D

> [!NOTE]
> All deeplinks must be encoded before pasting the URL. We don't support unencoded URLs.
>
> * The `name` is optional in deep link. If not included, the app name replaces it.
> * The deep link can also be passed through an `OpenURL` action.
> * When you launch a Stage from a certain context, ensure that your app works in that context. For example, if your Stage View is launched from a personal app, you must ensure your app has a personal scope.
