# Resource-specific consent

> [!NOTE]
> Resource-specific consent for chat scope is available in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) only.

Resource-specific consent (RSC) is a Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Graph API integration that enables your app to use API endpoints to manage specific resources, either teams or chats, within an organization. The RSC permissions model enables *team owners* and *chat owners* to grant consent for an application to access and modify a team's data and a chat's data, respectively.

**Note:** If a chat has a meeting or a call associated with it, then the relevant RSC permissions apply to those resources as well.

## Resource-specific permissions

The granular, Teams-specific, RSC permissions define what an application can do within a specific resource.

### Resource-specific permissions for a team

|Application permission| Action |
| ----- | ----- |
|TeamSettings.Read.Group | Get this team's settings.|
|TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group|Update this team's settings.|
|ChannelSettings.Read.Group|Get this team's channel names, channel descriptions, and channel settings​.|
|ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group|Update this team's channel names, channel descriptions, and channel settings.​|
|Channel.Create.Group|Create channels in this team. |
|Channel.Delete.Group|Delete channels in this team. |
|ChannelMessage.Read.Group |Get this team's channel messages. |
|TeamsAppInstallation.Read.Group|Get a list of this team's installed apps.|
|TeamsTab.Read.Group|Get a list of this team's tabs.|
|TeamsTab.Create.Group|Create tabs in this team. |
|TeamsTab.ReadWrite.Group|Update this team's tabs. |
|TeamsTab.Delete.Group|Delete this team's tabs. |
|TeamMember.Read.Group|Get this team's members. |
|TeamsActivity.Send.Group|Create new notifications in the activity feeds of the users in this team. |

For more details, see [team resource-specific consent permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#teams-resource-specific-consent-permissions).

## Configure consent settings in the Azure AD portal

### Configure group owner consent settings for RSC in a team

You can enable or disable [group owner consent](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent-groups?tabs=azure-portal) directly within the Microsoft Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a [Global Administrator or Company Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator&preserve-view=true).
1. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **Consent and permissions** > [**User consent settings**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConsentPoliciesMenuBlade/UserSettings).
1. Enable, disable, or limit user consent with the control labeled **Group owner consent for apps accessing data**. The default is **Allow group owner consent for all group owners**. For a team owner to install an app using RSC, group owner consent must be enabled for that user.

    ![Azure RSC team configuration](../../assets/images/azure-rsc-team-configuration.png)

In addition, you can enable or disable group owner consent using PowerShell, follow the steps outlined in [configure group owner consent using PowerShell](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent-groups?tabs=azure-powershell).

### Configure user consent settings for RSC in a chat

You can enable or disable [user consent](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?tabs=azure-portal) directly within the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a [Global Administrator or Company Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator&preserve-view=true).
1. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **Consent and permissions** > [**User consent settings**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConsentPoliciesMenuBlade/UserSettings).
1. Enable, disable, or limit user consent with the control labeled **User consent for applications**. The default is **Allow user consent for apps**. For a chat member to install an app using RSC, user consent must be enabled for that user.

    ![Azure RSC chat configuration](../../assets/images/azure-rsc-chat-configuration.png)

In addition, you can enable or disable user consent using PowerShell, follow the steps outlined in [configure user consent using PowerShell](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?tabs=azure-powershell).

## Register your app with Microsoft identity platform using the Azure AD portal

The Azure AD portal provides a central platform for you to register and configure your apps. Your app must be registered in the Azure AD portal to integrate with the identity platform and call Microsoft Graph APIs. For more information, see [register an application with the identity platform](/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

> [!WARNING]
> An Azure AD app ID must not be shared across multiple Teams apps. There must be a 1:1 mapping between a Teams app and an Azure AD app. Attempts to install multiple Teams apps which are associated with the same Azure AD app ID will cause installation or runtime failures.

## Review your application permissions in the Azure AD portal

1. Go to the **Home** > **App registrations** page and select your RSC app.
1. Choose **API permissions** from the left pane and go through the list of **Configured permissions** for your app. If your app only makes RSC Graph API calls, delete all the permissions on that page. If your app also makes non-RSC calls, keep those permissions as required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure AD portal cannot be used to request RSC permissions. RSC permissions are currently exclusive to Teams applications installed in the Teams client and are declared in the Teams app manifest (JSON) file.

## Obtain an access token from the Microsoft identity platform

To make Graph API calls, you must obtain an access token for your app from the identity platform. Before your app can get a token from the identity platform, it must be registered in the Azure AD portal. The access token contains information about your app and the permissions it has for the resources and APIs available through Microsoft Graph.

You must have the following values from the Azure AD registration process to retrieve an access token from the identity platform:

* The **Application ID** assigned by the app registration portal. If your app supports single sign-on (SSO) you must use the same Application ID for your app and SSO.
* The **Client secret/password** or a public or private key pair that is **Certificate**. This is not required for native apps.
* A **Redirect URI** or reply URL for your app to receive responses from Azure AD.

For more information, see [get access on behalf of a user](/graph/auth-v2-user?view=graph-rest-1.0#3-get-a-token&preserve-view=true) and [get access without a user](/graph/auth-v2-service).

## Update your Teams app manifest

The RSC permissions are declared in your app manifest JSON file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Non-RSC permissions are stored in the Azure portal. Do not add them to the app manifest.

## Sideload your app in Teams

If your Teams admin allows custom app uploads, you can [sideload your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md) directly to a specific team or chat.

## Check your app for added RSC permissions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The RSC permissions are not attributed to a user. Calls are made with app permissions, not user delegated permissions. The app can be allowed to perform actions that the user cannot, such as deleting a tab. You must review the team owner's or chat owner's intent for your use before making RSC API calls. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams API overview](/graph/teams-concept-overview).

After the app has been installed to a resource, you can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) to view the permissions that have been granted to the app in the resource.

### Check your app for added RSC permissions in a team

1. Get the team's **groupId** from Teams.
1. In Teams, select **Teams** from the leftmost pane.
1. Select the team where the app is to be installed.
1. Select the ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; for that team.
1. Select **Get link to team** from the team dropdown menu.
1. Copy and save the **groupId** value from the **Get a link to the team** pop-up dialog box.
1. Sign in to **Graph Explorer**.
1. Make a **GET** call to this endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams/{teamGroupId}/permissionGrants`. The `clientAppId` field in the response will map to the `webApplicationInfo.id` specified in the Teams app manifest.

    ![Graph explorer response to GET call for team RSC permissions](../../assets/images/team-graph-permissions.png)

For more information on how to get details of the apps installed in a specific team, see [get the names and other details of apps installed in the specified team](/graph/api/team-list-installedapps#example-2-get-the-names-and-other-details-of-installed-apps).

### Check your app for added RSC permissions in a chat

1. Get the chat thread ID from the Teams *web* client.
1. In the Teams web client, select **Chat** from the leftmost pane.
1. Select the chat where the app is installed from the dropdown menu.
1. Copy the web URL and save the chat thread ID from the string.

    ![Chat thread ID from web URL](../../assets/images/chat-thread-id.png)

1. Sign in to **Graph Explorer**.
1. Make a **GET** call to the following endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/chats/{chatId}/permissionGrants`. The `clientAppId` field in the response will map to the `webApplicationInfo.id` specified in the Teams app manifest.

    ![Graph explorer response to GET call for chat RSC permissions](../../assets/images/chat-graph-permissions.png)

For more information on how to get details of apps installed in a specific chat, see [get the names and other details of apps installed in the specified chat](/graph/api/chat-list-installedapps#example-2-get-the-names-and-other-details-of-apps-installed-in-the-specified-chat).
